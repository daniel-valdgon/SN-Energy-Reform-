*Fuels 
//a. File 08_fuelsubsidies.do: Apply new q for fuels using your new weights
//b  2b_fuels.do VAT and direct: Be sure that each scenario is reading the composite mp composite sub price: for VAT and direct effect
//c. 2b_fuels.do Indirect: Be sure to load the composite subsidy  
//d  1d_fuels.do: Be sure to uprate the composite quantities in 1d (this code does not exist at all)


*Electricity 
// *a. Compute the subsidy for firms using the neww decree of 2022-54. Compute shares for each type of profesional (IMF)
// *b.	Petra does not give tranches therefore we need to use tranches 

*---------------- Pendent:
*Update of ppt for Jan
	*a. Run the tool with the excel main
	*b. Check that the tool rnew results match what I shared to Gabriela in the ppt on Friday
	*c. Update ppt with figures that are still missing (Absolute incidence in billions)
	
	
*Change the strategy to split fuels by splitting them at the very beggining: q_fuel_ord q_fuel_gasoil q_fuel_super
*Update the paramter of pre-paid customers
*Update the changes implemented 
*Adapt subsidies analysis to use expenditure rather than quantities 
	* See if its consequential and fix  to use s/(1-s) rather than q. This would be better to have a spending completely affected by the netdown
	* Also it will allow that shocks to fuel affect the proper spending on electricity (in the case, which does not apply, that electricity were not regulated) 

*Separate fuels by butane, gasoline (super, premium), kerosene
*Separate electricity subsidies by subsidy tranche 1, trance 2 and tranche 3
